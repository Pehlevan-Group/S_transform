This repository serves to reproduce all figures in the paper "Scaling and Renormalization in High-Dimensional Regresson": https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00592 , as well as "Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples": https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607

Each notebook is fully self-contained and produces all empirical and analytic results in a variety of settings.
